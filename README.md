## üßó Challenges We Ran Into
- **Real-time proctoring:** Integrating camera, pose, and tab monitoring in a privacy-respecting way was complex. We used a combination of browser APIs, custom logic, and Groq's Whisper API for speech-to-text.
- **Mock interview realism:** Making the AI avatar feel natural and helpful required prompt engineering and careful system design.
- **Database migrations:** Handling evolving requirements (e.g., new analytics fields, DSA/HR/Technical modes) meant frequent schema changes and careful migration management.
- **Frontend/Backend sync:** Ensuring all interview modes (DSA, HR, Technical) handled topics, analytics, and chat history correctly across API and UI.
- **Error handling:** Building robust error handling for async interview flows, proctoring, and analytics.
